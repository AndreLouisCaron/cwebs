Description
===========

This library provides a parser for the `WebSocket`_ wire protocol.  The parser
is implemented as a finite state machine (FSM) for use in streaming applications
(i.e. data arrives at an unpredictable rate and the parser must be
interruptible).  As such, the parser itself does not buffer any received data.
It just forwards it to registered callbacks.  It requires little overhead and is
well suited for being used in an object-oriented wrapper.

Demonstration
=============

There's a C++-based tunnel program with both UNIX and Windows implementations
based on nothing but the native APIs.  They can be used to tunnel arbitrary
data exchange over port 80, all with standard HTTP semantics for virtual
hosting, URL-based dispatch, encryption, etc. (caveat: very few web servers
implement facilities for such a dispatch given WebSockets).

There's a full-blown WebSockets server based on `Qt`_ and the `http-parser`_
library.  You can test the echo server with the echo client project which is
implemented using the `HTML 5 WebSocket API`_ and jQuery_.

Compiling
=========

This library provides a CMake_ build script.  To compile the library, download
and install CMake_, and then generate build scripts for your favorite build
tool.

On Microsoft Windows
--------------------

#. launch the visual studio command prompt

#. check out the source code (or download a source code bundle)

   ::

      git clone git@github.com:AndreLouisCaron/cwebs.git
      cd cwebs
      git submodule init
      git submodule update

#. generate NMake project files

   ::

      mkdir work
      cd work
      cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..

#. compile the libraries and tests

   ::

      nmake

#. build the HTML documentation (optional)

   ::

      nmake doc

#. run the tests (optional)

   ::

      nmake /A test

You can use JOM_ as an alternative to NMake to accelerate builds on
multi-processor machines.  Use the ``"NMake Makefiles JOM"`` CMake
generator and use ``jom`` instead of NMake.  Beware that the ``test``
target is broken and you must still invoke ``nmake /A test`` to run
the tests.

On UNIX-like systems
--------------------

#. launch your favorite terminal

#. check out the source code (or download a source code bundle)

   ::

      git clone git@github.com:AndreLouisCaron/cwebs.git
      cd cwebs
      git submodule init
      git submodule update

#. generate Makefiles

   ::

      mkdir work
      cd work
      cmake ..

#. compile the libraries and tests

   ::

      make

#. build the HTML documentation (optional)

   ::

      make doc

#. run the tests (optional)

   ::

      make test
